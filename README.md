# EV-Charging-Station-Project

Electric cars are a technology that will overcome their predecessor which is the internal 
combustion cars that most people use. However, most people are still reluctant to purchase an 
electric car due to lack of infrastructure such as electric vehicle charging stations. With the need 
for electric vehicle charging stations, we created this data analysis with the goal of **finding the 
best location for expanding electric vehicle charging stations and gain a better understanding of 
pricing standard and expectation**

## Dataset
The dataset collected was a list of EV charging stations with multiple information to each. Most 
of the data are not relatable and are not analyzed as they have multiple NAN values or do not 
have a consistent input. For this research, columns that are used include locations, product 
pricing, and EV levels. The popoluation and ev registration data are used as supplement for analysis.

## Distribution
In particular, by comparing the number of charging station from the dataset to the number of 
registered EVs (denoted by Ev Station Rate), the market for charging station in California and 
Texas has not yet reached saturation point.
